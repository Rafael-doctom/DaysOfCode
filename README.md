# 100 days of code

This is a repository for my 100 days of code challenge. I will be using this repository to track my progress and to share my code.
This challenge is inspired by [Ismael Apolinario](https://github.com/IAPOLINARIO/100-days-of-code)

## Rules

- Code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days including weekends/holidays.

- Don't copy code from other people.

- Try to come up with a clean and elegant solution.

- Always write tests for your code.
